# Membrane Segmentation Tool Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the four buttons available for membrane segmentation using the Napari plugin. Each button is designed to assist users in segmenting membrane areas effectively.

## Button 1: **Draw Membrane Area Mod**

This button allows you to draw points along the membrane center. Specifically, you should place points on the initial, middle, and final three Z-axis planes, as well as one additional point inside the membrane on another Z-axis. Once you have placed the points, clicking the button will generate a prompt for membrane segmentation.

If the validation passes, the points are saved as `.mod` files and used as prompts for membrane segmentation.

## Button 2: **Stsyseg**

Clicking this button opens a parameter input window. You can input the pixel size manually, or it will be automatically imported from the tomogram if left blank. The `extend` parameter defines the measurement range for membrane segmentation and extends along the drawn prompt. Pressing "Apply" will execute the membrane segmentation.

## Button 3: **Visualize**

This button displays the segmentation result in the Napari main window. It allows you to visualize the segmentation effect directly and verify if it meets your expectations.

## Button 4: **Manually Draw**

If you are not satisfied with the automatic segmentation, this button allows you to manually draw the segmentation. You can go through the frames one-by-one and draw the membrane manually to correct the segmentation results.
