# Membrane Segmentation Tool Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the four buttons available for membrane segmentation using the Napari plugin. Each button is designed to assist users in segmenting membrane areas effectively.

## Button 1: **Draw Membrane Area Mod**

This function is used to annotate the membrane activation area by adding point prompts in `area.mod`. Follow the steps below to correctly mark the membrane region:

Mark membrane points on three different z-planes

Select three distinct z-planes: one at the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end of the z-axis range.
On each selected z-plane, place at least two points along the middle of the membrane.
Add a presynaptic point on a different z-plane

Choose a z-plane that is different from the three selected in step 1.
Place one point in the presynaptic region.
Validate and save the points

Click the "Draw Membrane Area Mod" button.
If the operation is successful, a message will appear:

```
Points validated and saved successfully.
```

## Button 2: **Stsyseg**

Clicking this button opens a parameter input window. You can input the pixel size manually, or it will be automatically imported from the tomogram if left blank. The `extend` parameter defines the measurement range for membrane segmentation and extends along the drawn prompt. Pressing "Apply" will execute the membrane segmentation.

## Button 3: **Visualize**

This button displays the segmentation result in the Napari main window. It allows you to visualize the segmentation effect directly and verify if it meets your expectations.

## Button 4: **Manually Draw**

If you are not satisfied with the automatic segmentation, this button allows you to manually draw the segmentation. You can go through the frames one-by-one and draw the membrane manually to correct the segmentation results.
