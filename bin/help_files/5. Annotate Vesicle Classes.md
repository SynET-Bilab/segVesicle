# Vesicle Analysis Buttons Documentation

## Calculate Vesicle to Membrane Distance
This button calculates the distance from each vesicle to the membrane using the vesicle segmentation data from a JSON file and the membrane segmentation data from a `.mod` file.

## Filter Vesicles by Distance
This button filters out vesicles with distances greater than a specified threshold and visualizes the remaining vesicles for further analysis.

## Annotate Pit
This button allows the user to annotate pits by marking three points on the image.

## Annotate Vesicle Type
This button is used to annotate the specific type of vesicles that are within the defined distance threshold.

## Multi-class Visualization
This button visualizes the different classes of annotated vesicles, making it easier to differentiate between various vesicle types.

## Export Final Vesicle Data
This button exports the final vesicle data to an XML file, using the original pixel size provided by the user.
